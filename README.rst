JS_builder
==========

`JS_builder` is a JavaScript dependency management tool. We can define for all files dependencies which are required e.g. file core.js must be add before all other files because it contains main namespace. Files are concatenated in the right order and minimize. When template are rendered and some packages must be added to that page system checks if there were some modifications in files from package and rebuild it automatically.
