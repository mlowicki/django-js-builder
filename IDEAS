usage: 

1) user download app somehow,
2) add django-js-builder to the INSTALLED_APPS,
3) configure app,
4) configure JavaScript files,
5) after each request app checks if there were some modifications in tracked files
and if there were changes building process is started and packages with 
concatenated [and minified] js files are created.


3) configure app
    1) define packages e.g. package named "widget":

        widget = ['libs/yui/dom.js', 'core.js', 'widget_.*\.js']
        dialog = ['dialog_*.js']
        all = ['*.js']

    2) define root directory with JavaScript files and destination directory, 
    3) add packages to the page source:
	
        [...]
        {% load js_builder %}
	<head>
	    {% load_js_package widget %}
        </head>
        [...]

        [...]
        {% load js_builder %}
        <head>
            {% load_js_package dialog %}
            {% load_js_package widget %}

            or 

            {% load_js_packages dialog widget %}
        </head>
        [...]

4) configure JavaScript files - define dependencies in JavaScript files e.g.
        
        single file
	//{% require core.js %}

        several files
        //
        {% require core.js %}
        {% require ui.js %}
        {% ajax.js %}
        
        or

        // 
        {% require core.js ui.js ajax.js %}
        
        all package
        //{% require widget %} 

other:

1) Toolbar like in django-debug-toolbar with information about packages and files they contains, time,
file sizes etc. Option for disable and enable building. Information about errors and warnings. Show
info which packages were created during last request;

2) Maybe building process can take too much time in some situations so there must be some option for
disable builder maybe via GET parameter like: js_builder=0 or jsb=0;

3) Create data streams for embedding image :

el.setStyle("background-image", "{% image_b64 bg.png %}");

is replaced by:

el.setStyle("background-image", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARQA...");

4) django command for manual building e.g. on public server,

5) disable/enable code compressor.
